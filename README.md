Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project was used to track the inputs given program that analyzes the text records they generate throughout the day. These records list items purchased in chronological order from the time the store opens to the time it closes. 

What did you do particularly well?
This particular project was a great learning expierence for me at SNHU. I wont say I did anything particularly well other than solved my own problems that I ran into and strived to complete the project no matter what because my grade depended on it.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I felt that the ideas from my code should come more naturally through repitition. Being more comfortable as a coder will ensure that my code will be more efficient as well as my work flow. 

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I found it most challenging to incorporate the Python code with C++, It was a great challenge and I enjoyed the process. The research and time that I put into the project taught me quite a bit and going forward I will have more confidence to tackle other projects. Most of the tools I am currently using are adding to my skillset and practice through research and repitition. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
I think all of the projects that I have worked on at SNHU will serve a good purpose now that I am a student, I am focused on what I need to do to become a valuable programmer. Each new thing learned can be a confidence boost and that in itself is a great transferable. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The incorporation of #notes and explanations throughout my code was a habit that I have been doing in projects since beginning this course work and I think it will serve me quite well going into the future. I can thank my professor for making sure the habit was instilled into all my projects.
